## üîí Human-in-the-Loop

**All calendar changes require your approval!**

1. AI creates a **proposal** (not on calendar yet)
2. You review the details
3. You approve or reject
4. Only approved events are created

This prevents accidental meetings and gives you full control.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

**"Credentials not found"**
‚Üí Place `credentials.json` in project root

**"Authentication failed"**
‚Üí Delete `token.json` and try again

**"API not enabled"**
‚Üí Enable Google Calendar API in Cloud Console
