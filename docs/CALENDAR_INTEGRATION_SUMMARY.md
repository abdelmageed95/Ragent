# Google Calendar & Meet Integration - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

I've successfully added Google Calendar and Google Meet integration with **human-in-the-loop verification** to your agentic RAG system. Here's what was created:

---

## 📁 New Files Created

### 1. **Core Tool** - `tools/google_calendar_tool.py`
   - Complete Google Calendar API integration
   - OAuth2 authentication handling
   - Event viewing, creation, and management
   - Human-in-the-loop proposal system
   - Natural language date/time parsing
   - Google Meet link generation

### 2. **API Endpoints** - `core/api/calendar.py`
   - `GET /api/calendar/events` - View calendar events
   - `POST /api/calendar/events/propose` - Create event proposals
   - `GET /api/calendar/pending` - List pending approvals
   - `POST /api/calendar/approve` - Approve/reject proposals
   - `POST /api/calendar/authenticate` - Trigger authentication

### 3. **Documentation**
   - `docs/GOOGLE_CALENDAR_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide
   - `docs/CALENDAR_QUICK_START.md` - 5-minute quick start
   - `docs/CALENDAR_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

---

## 🔧 Modified Files

### 1. **Chat Agent** - `graph/chat_node.py`
   - Added calendar tools to the chatbot
   - Integrated approval/rejection handling
   - Updated system prompts with calendar capabilities

### 2. **Main Application** - `main.py`
   - Registered calendar API router
   - Enabled calendar endpoints

### 3. **Dependencies** - `requirements.txt`
   - Added Google Calendar API packages
   - Added date parsing utilities

### 4. **Enhancement Ideas** - `SYSTEM_ENHANCEMENT_IDEAS.md`

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **View Calendar Events**
Natural language queries like:
- "Show my meetings today"
- "What's on my calendar tomorrow?"
- "List events for next Monday"

### 2. **Create Meeting Proposals**
The AI can create proposals from commands like:
- "Schedule a meeting with john@example.com tomorrow at 2 PM"
- "Create a 1-hour video call with team@company.com at 3 PM"

### 3. **Human-in-the-Loop Verification**
- All calendar changes require explicit user approval
- Proposals show complete details before creation
- Users can approve or reject with simple commands
- Prevents accidental or incorrect meeting creation

### 4. **Google Meet Integration**
- Automatically adds Google Meet links to meetings
- Configurable per-meeting
- Works seamlessly with Google Workspace

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### Workflow Example:

```
User: "Schedule a meeting with alice@example.com tomorrow at 3 PM for 1 hour"

AI: Creates a proposal and responds:
    "I've prepared a calendar event for your approval:

     Title: Meeting with alice@example.com
     Start: 2025-10-19 15:00:00
     End: 2025-10-19 16:00:00
     Attendees: alice@example.com
     Google Meet: Will be added

     Proposal ID: proposal_0

     To approve: 'Approve proposal_0'
     To reject: 'Reject proposal_0'"

User: "Approve proposal_0"

AI: Creates the event and responds:
    "✅ Event 'Meeting with alice@example.com' has been created!

     📅 Event Details:
     - Start: 2025-10-19T15:00:00Z
     - End: 2025-10-19T16:00:00Z
     - Calendar Link: https://calendar.google.com/...
     - Google Meet: https://meet.google.com/..."
```

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **OAuth2 Authentication**
   - Secure Google account integration
   - Token refresh handling
   - Credential protection

2. **Human Approval Required**
   - No automatic calendar modifications
   - All changes require explicit consent
   - Clear visibility into what will be created

3. **Credential Management**
   - Credentials stored locally (not in database)
   - Token encryption
   - Automatic token refresh

---

1. ✅ Create Google Cloud Project
2. ✅ Enable Google Calendar API
3. ✅ Create OAuth2 credentials
4. ✅ Download `credentials.json`
5. ✅ Place in project root
6. ✅ Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 🎨 User Experience

### Natural Language Understanding
The system can extract event details from conversational input:

**Input**: "Book a meeting with john@example.com next Friday at 10 AM for 30 minutes about project review"

**Extracted**:
- Summary: "project review"
- Attendee: john@example.com
- Date: Next Friday
- Time: 10:00 AM
- Duration: 30 minutes

### Intelligent Defaults
- Duration: 60 minutes (if not specified)
- Google Meet: Added by default
- Timezone: Uses system timezone

---

## 🔄 API Examples

### View Events (curl)
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/calendar/events?date=tomorrow"
```

### Create Proposal (curl)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/calendar/events/propose" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "summary": "Team Meeting",
    "start_datetime": "tomorrow 2 PM",
    "duration_minutes": 60,
    "attendees": ["john@example.com"],
    "add_meet_link": true
  }'
```

### Approve Proposal (curl)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/calendar/approve" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "proposal_id": "proposal_0",
    "approved": true
  }'
```

## 🚧 Limitations & Considerations

### Current Limitations:
1. **Single Calendar**: Only supports primary calendar (can be extended)
2. **Single User**: One Google account per instance (can be extended for multi-user)
3. **Basic NLP**: Date/time parsing works for common patterns (can be improved)
4. **No Conflict Detection**: Doesn't check for scheduling conflicts (future enhancement)
5. **No Recurring Events**: Single events only (can be extended)

### Google Account Requirements:
- Google Workspace or personal Google account
- Google Calendar enabled
- Google Meet access (for video links)

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Easy Additions:
1. **Conflict Detection** - Check for overlapping meetings
2. **Recurring Events** - Support weekly/monthly meetings
3. **Event Updates** - Modify existing events
4. **Event Deletion** - Cancel meetings
5. **Multi-Calendar Support** - Work with multiple calendars
6. **Attendee Availability** - Check attendee free/busy status
7. **Smart Scheduling** - Find optimal meeting times
8. **Time Zone Intelligence** - Better timezone handling

### Advanced Features:
1. **Meeting Templates** - Predefined meeting types
2. **Auto-Summarization** - Generate meeting agendas
3. **Follow-up Tracking** - Track action items from meetings
4. **Integration with Email** - Send custom invites
5. **Calendar Analytics** - Meeting time analysis

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Credentials not found"**
- Ensure `credentials.json` is in project root
- Re-download from Google Cloud Console

**"Authentication failed"**
- Delete `token.json` and re-authenticate
- Check OAuth consent screen configuration

**"API not enabled"**
- Enable Google Calendar API in Cloud Console

**"Insufficient permissions"**
- Check OAuth scopes in consent screen
- Ensure calendar read/write scopes are added

**Full troubleshooting**: See `docs/GOOGLE_CALENDAR_SETUP.md`

4. **Extend** with additional features (recurring events, conflict detection)
5. **Integrate** with other services (email, Slack notifications)

---

## 💡 Usage Tips

1. **Be specific** with dates and times: "tomorrow at 2 PM" works better than "later"
2. **Include attendee emails** for automatic invitations
3. **Review proposals carefully** before approving
4. **Use pending actions** to see what's waiting: "Show pending actions"
5. **Test with personal calendar** before production use
